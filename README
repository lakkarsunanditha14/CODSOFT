# Image Captioning using Computer Vision and NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project combines **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to build an **Image Captioning AI system**.  
The model automatically generates a meaningful textual description (caption) for a given image.

A **pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16)** is used to extract visual features from images, and a **Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)** is used to generate captions based on those features.

This project is developed as part of the **CodSoft Internship Program**.
