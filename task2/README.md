A fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python, where you compete against an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.
Play directly in your terminal and see how well you can strategize against artificial intelligence!

Overview:
This project recreates the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game, where:
1.You play as X
2.The computer plays as O
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which enables it to always make the optimal move — meaning it can never lose!
Your goal is to win, or at least manage a tie.

Technologies Used:

1.Language: Python 3
2.Algorithm: Minimax (AI decision-making)
3.Interface: Command Line

How to Play:

1.You’ll be prompted to enter a row (1–3) and column (1–3) for your move.
2The board updates, and the AI (O) makes its move automatically.
3.The game ends when:
You win 🎉
The AI wins 
Or it’s a tie 
How the AI Works

The AI uses the Minimax Algorithm, a recursive strategy from game theory.
It explores all possible future moves and picks the one that:
1.Maximizes its chance of winning, and
2.Minimizes yours.
This ensures the AI always makes the best possible move. The only way to avoid losing is to play perfectly!️
